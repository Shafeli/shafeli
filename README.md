### 🧰 What I Do

🚀 I build engines — both 2D & 3D — to explore the inner workings of game development  
🛠️ I also create tools, editors, and automation systems with tech like **Python** and **WinForms**  
🎯 I aim for elegant, practical solutions — balancing clean architecture with realistic implementation time  
🧠 Always experimenting to grow my knowledge and solve real-world problems

### 🧭 What I’m Doing Now

🛠️ **Currently building**: A lightweight, modular 3D engine from scratch  
- Purpose: Deepen my understanding of rendering pipelines, ECS, and engine architecture  
- Stack: C++, OpenGL, custom math/physics systems  
- Challenges: Managing data-oriented design, optimizing for performance, keeping the codebase maintainable  
- Goal: Use this as a learning lab, and eventually open source it as a reference for other devs

🧪 **Exploring**: Custom tooling with Python & WinForms  
- Building productivity tools to automate common tasks in game asset pipelines  
- Focused on fast iteration and clean, user-friendly interfaces

📚 **Learning**:  
- Advanced rendering techniques (deferred rendering, real-time shadows, GPU optimization)  
- ECS (Entity Component System) patterns and data-driven design  
- How large engines like Unity and Unreal solve problems at scale

🧩 **Experimenting with**:  
- Unity DOTS for high-performance workflows  
- Unreal Engine’s enhanced Blueprints & C++ systems  

🎯 **Why it matters**:  
I'm passionate about systems that empower creators — whether it’s game engines or the tools that support them. I aim to balance clean architecture with realistic implementation time, always building with purpose and curiosity.
