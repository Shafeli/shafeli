### 👋 About Me 
##### I build modular systems that bridge software engineering and digital fabrication.
Former chef turned full‑stack engineer and fabrication strategist. I build practical, self‑hosted systems with .NET Core, EF Core, and Docker, while also designing and producing physical products through CAD, engraving, and 3D printing.

My work spans both software engineering and digital fabrication — from APIs and microservices to NFC‑enabled containers, custom engravings, and modular product systems. I thrive on rapid prototyping, iterative design, and bridging digital workflows with real‑world hardware.

### 🧰 What I Do  
- 🛠️ Develop secure, modular backend services with **ASP.NET Core**, **SQL Server**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **Docker**  
- 🌐 Build Blazor frontends and self-hosted apps for real-world use (home lab deployments, internal tools)  
- 🤖 Integrate **LLMs as microservices** into private infrastructure using Docker + Ollama  
- ⚡ Automate workflows and optimize developer experience  
- 🔬 Explore systems internals with **C++**, **Vulkan**, and engine architecture
- ⚙️ Design and fabricate physical products with Onshape, engraving workflows, and print farm systems
- 🔧 Prototype custom hardware solutions (NFC containers, grinders, coasters, modular accessories)
- 🚀 Partner with businesses to deliver branded fabrication solutions and external tech support
