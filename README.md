### 👋 About Me  
Former chef turned backend developer who builds practical, self-hosted systems with .NET Core, EF Core, and Docker. I specialize in designing APIs, connecting services, and deploying real tools that solve everyday problems. I also have deep experience with engine internals and low-level systems from years of C++ work.  

---

### 🧰 What I Do  
- 🛠️ Develop secure, modular backend services with **ASP.NET Core**, **SQL Server**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **Docker**  
- 🌐 Build Blazor frontends and self-hosted apps for real-world use (home lab deployments, internal tools)  
- ⚡ Automate workflows and optimize developer experience  
- 🔬 Explore systems internals with **C++**, **Vulkan**, and engine architecture (secondary focus)
