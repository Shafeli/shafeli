### 🧰 What I Do

🚀 I build engines — both 2D & 3D — to explore the inner workings of game development  
🛠️ I also create tools, editors, and automation systems with tech like **Python** and **WinForms**  
🎯 I aim for elegant, practical solutions — balancing clean architecture with realistic implementation time  
🧠 Always experimenting to grow my knowledge and solve real-world problems
